# Yellowhorn genome project

## Best blast hit between yellowhron and other species
`best_blast.sh`

## Expression
- mapping the rnaseq reads to genome using hisat2 and call count using htseq-count

  `xso_gene_expr.sh`

- convert the raw counts generated from htseq-count to vst using DEseq2

  `convert_counts_to_VST.R`

- remove non-varying genes

  `vst_filter.R`

- Calculate co-expression network using Seidr

  - Infer: Independent gene-gene networks are created by a multitude of algorithms
  
    `seidr_algorithms.sh`
    
  - Import: In order to merge these networks, they are first sorted and ranked
  
    `seidr_import.sh`
    
  - Aggregate: Once all methods are ready, seidr can aggregate them to a crowd network
  
    `seidr_aggregate.sh`
    
  - Estimate a hard threshold for a given seidr network
  
    `seidr_threshold.sh`

  - Construct the backbone network
  
    `backbone.sh`
    
  - Compare the backbone network and threshold network
  
    Two principles:
    (1) We would like to select the backbone network for further analysis.
    (2) The genes in the backbone network should contain the important genes (we determine whether the unique genes is important      
        according to use the GO enrichment analysis) found in the threshold network as much as possible.
  
    `compare.sh`
    
  - run `seidr roc` for 'irp' aggregated network, backbone networks and threshold (irp, 0.28) network
    
    `roc.sh`
    
  - Visualize the comparisons
  
    `visualize_comparisons.sh`

## GO, PFAM and KEGG enrichment
`enrichment_files.sh`

## Jbrowse

`configure.sh`
